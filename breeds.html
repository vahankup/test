                    Great Danes have been around for a long time, and depictions of Dane-like dogs on artifacts date back thousands of years. Although this is a pure breed of dog, you may find them in shelters and rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you decide this
                    is the dog for you. Great Danes certainly hold stature in the dog world; but though they look terribly imposing, in reality they’re one of the best-natured dogs around. For all of their size, Great Danes are sweet, affectionate pets.
                    They love to play and are gentle with children.

                    Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience. These dogs
                    are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and smart companion, consider adopting one of these pups into your pack.

                    The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds — for good reasons. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile. The breed also goes by the name Alsatian.
                    Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to adopt! Don’t shop if this is the breed for you. GSDs excel at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance
                    work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and — last but not least — faithful companion.

                    The American Pit Bull Terrier is a companion and family dog breed. Originally bred to “bait” bulls, the breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become “nanny dogs” because they were so gentle around children. Even though
                    these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home. Their tenacity, gameness, and courage make them popular competitors in the sports of
                    weight pulling, agility, and obedience. Of course, you can also find them living as companions, showering their humans with love and affection.

                    The Rottweiler was originally dogs bred to drive cattle to market. Later they were used to pull carts for butchers. They were among the earliest police dogs and serve with honor in the military. Most important, they are popular family guardians and friends.
                    Novice pet parents should beware, as these dogs are strong and intense. They need experienced care and training. Consistent, energetic pet parents will find a loving, faithful, and intelligent friend for life in a Rottie!

                    The Chihuahua dog breed‘s charms include their small size, big personality, and variety in coat types and colors. They’re all dog, fully capable of competing in dog sports such as agility and obedience, and are among the top ten watchdogs recommended
                    by experts. Although these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home. Chihuahuas love nothing more than being with their people — even novice pet
                    parents — and require a minimum of grooming and exercise. They make excellent apartment dogs who’ll get along with the whole family. Just make sure any children who approach know how to play gently with a small dog.
